Below, you’ll find the Fibonacci Clock project I created. This clock presents time using the Fibonacci sequence, offering a unique and visually captivating way to keep track of the hours, minutes, and seconds.

Each circle on the clock represents a number in the Fibonacci sequence, with colors distinguishing between the hours, minutes, and seconds. It’s a playful yet functional design that I had a lot of fun building!

When you click on the clock, you’ll get more details about how it works, and you can even customize the colors to your liking.
Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!

# Technical Details
This project was built using Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications. I utilized Angular to create a responsive and interactive Fibonacci clock that’s both functional and visually appealing.

Once completed, I deployed the project to GitHub Pages, a free hosting service that allows me to share the clock with others easily. GitHub Pages serves the project directly from my GitHub repository, making it a simple and efficient way to host static websites.

Feel free to explore the source code on my GitHub repository to see how it all comes together!
