## Building a Cost-Free, Automated Portfolio Website with GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Prose.io

When I set out to create my portfolio website, I wanted to demonstrate how to build and maintain a fully functional, hosted website without incurring any costs. My goal was to create a proof of concept that showcases how free tools and services can be combined to automate content deployment and hosting. Here's how I did it, and the technologies that made it possible.

## The Intent: A Cost-Free, Automated Solution
The primary goal of this project was to create a portfolio website that:

1. Hosts content for free: No paid hosting services or domain fees.
2. Supports automated deployment: No manual build or deployment steps.
3. Allows easy content creation: A user-friendly interface for adding and editing content without touching code.

To achieve this, I leveraged the following technologies:

- GitHub: For version control and repository management.
- GitHub Pages: For free static website hosting.
- Jekyll: For static site generation and local development.
- Prose.io: For content creation and management.

Let’s break down each technology and how they work together.

##  Technologies

### 1. GitHub

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories. For this project, GitHub serves as the backbone:

- Repository: My portfolio website’s code and content are stored in a GitHub repository.
- Version Control: Changes to the website are tracked using Git, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
- Collaboration: GitHub allows multiple contributors to work on the same project.

### 2. GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a repository. Key features include:

- Free Hosting: GitHub Pages hosts your website for free, with a default domain (e.g., username.github.io).
- Automatic Deployment: When you push changes to your repository, GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys your site.
- Custom Domains: You can use a custom domain if desired (though this is optional and not necessary for this proof of concept).

### 3. Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text (written in Markdown or HTML) into a fully functional website. It’s particularly well-suited for GitHub Pages because:

- Local Development: Jekyll allows you to build and preview your site locally before deploying it.
- Markdown Support: Content can be written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that’s easy to learn and use.
- Themes and Plugins: Jekyll supports themes and plugins, making it easy to customize your site’s design and functionality.
- Integration with GitHub Pages: GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, so you don’t need to manually build your site before deploying it.

### 4. Prose.io

Prose.io is a web-based content editor designed for static websites, particularly those built with Jekyll. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing content without needing to touch the command line or code. Key features include:

- Markdown Editor: A live Markdown editor with a preview pane.
- Front Matter Support: Easily edit Jekyll’s front matter (metadata for posts and pages).
- GitHub Integration: Prose.io connects directly to your GitHub repository, allowing you to create, edit, and publish content with a few clicks.

## How They Work Together

Here’s how these technologies come together to create a seamless, cost-free workflow:

### 1. Local Development with Jekyll:

- I use Jekyll to build and preview my website locally. This allows me to test changes before deploying them.
- Jekyll’s Markdown support makes it easy to write blog posts and pages.

### 2. Content Creation with Prose.io:

- When I want to add a new blog post or page, I use Prose.io. It provides a simple interface for writing Markdown and editing front matter.
- Prose.io saves the changes directly to my GitHub repository.

### 3. Version Control with GitHub:

- All changes made through Prose.io or local development are tracked in my GitHub repository.
- GitHub’s version control ensures that I can always revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.

### 4. Automatic Deployment with GitHub Pages:

- Whenever I push changes to my repository (either through Prose.io or local development), GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys my site.
- This eliminates the need for manual build or deployment commands.

## The Proof of Concept

This portfolio website serves as a proof of concept for a cost-free, automated content deployment workflow. By combining GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Prose.io, I’ve demonstrated that it’s possible to:

- Host a website for free.
- Automate the deployment process.
- Simplify content creation with a user-friendly interface.

This approach is ideal for developers, writers, and anyone looking to create a personal website or blog without incurring costs or dealing with complex infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio website has been a rewarding experience, and it’s shown me the power of combining free, open-source tools to create a robust and efficient workflow. Whether you’re a developer looking to showcase your work or a writer wanting to share your thoughts, this proof of concept demonstrates that you don’t need a big budget to create a professional, hosted website.
