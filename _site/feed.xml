<p>When I set out to create my portfolio website, I wanted to demonstrate how to build and maintain a fully functional, hosted website without incurring any costs. My goal was to create a proof of concept that showcases how free tools and services can be combined to automate content deployment and hosting. Here’s how I did it, and the technologies that made it possible.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-intent-a-cost-free-automated-solution">The Intent: A Cost-Free, Automated Solution</h2>
<p>The primary goal of this project was to create a portfolio website that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hosts content for free: No paid hosting services or domain fees.</li>
  <li>Supports automated deployment: No manual build or deployment steps.</li>
  <li>Allows easy content creation: A user-friendly interface for adding and editing content without touching code.</li>
</ol>

<p>To achieve this, I leveraged the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: For version control and repository management.</li>
  <li>GitHub Pages: For free static website hosting.</li>
  <li>Jekyll: For static site generation and local development.</li>
  <li>Prose.io: For content creation and management.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s break down each technology and how they work together.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>

<h3 id="1-github">1. GitHub</h3>

<p>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories. For this project, GitHub serves as the backbone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Repository: My portfolio website’s code and content are stored in a GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>Version Control: Changes to the website are tracked using Git, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.</li>
  <li>Collaboration: GitHub allows multiple contributors to work on the same project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-github-pages">2. GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a repository. Key features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free Hosting: GitHub Pages hosts your website for free, with a default domain (e.g., username.github.io).</li>
  <li>Automatic Deployment: When you push changes to your repository, GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys your site.</li>
  <li>Custom Domains: You can use a custom domain if desired (though this is optional and not necessary for this proof of concept).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-jekyll">3. Jekyll</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text (written in Markdown or HTML) into a fully functional website. It’s particularly well-suited for GitHub Pages because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local Development: Jekyll allows you to build and preview your site locally before deploying it.</li>
  <li>Markdown Support: Content can be written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that’s easy to learn and use.</li>
  <li>Themes and Plugins: Jekyll supports themes and plugins, making it easy to customize your site’s design and functionality.</li>
  <li>Integration with GitHub Pages: GitHub Pages natively supports Jekyll, so you don’t need to manually build your site before deploying it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-proseio">4. Prose.io</h3>

<p>Prose.io is a web-based content editor designed for static websites, particularly those built with Jekyll. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and editing content without needing to touch the command line or code. Key features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Markdown Editor: A live Markdown editor with a preview pane.</li>
  <li>Front Matter Support: Easily edit Jekyll’s front matter (metadata for posts and pages).</li>
  <li>GitHub Integration: Prose.io connects directly to your GitHub repository, allowing you to create, edit, and publish content with a few clicks.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-they-work-together">How They Work Together</h2>

<p>Here’s how these technologies come together to create a seamless, cost-free workflow:</p>

<h3 id="1-local-development-with-jekyll">1. Local Development with Jekyll:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I use Jekyll to build and preview my website locally. This allows me to test changes before deploying them.</li>
  <li>Jekyll’s Markdown support makes it easy to write blog posts and pages.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-content-creation-with-proseio">2. Content Creation with Prose.io:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When I want to add a new blog post or page, I use Prose.io. It provides a simple interface for writing Markdown and editing front matter.</li>
  <li>Prose.io saves the changes directly to my GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-version-control-with-github">3. Version Control with GitHub:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All changes made through Prose.io or local development are tracked in my GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>GitHub’s version control ensures that I can always revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-automatic-deployment-with-github-pages">4. Automatic Deployment with GitHub Pages:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Whenever I push changes to my repository (either through Prose.io or local development), GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys my site.</li>
  <li>This eliminates the need for manual build or deployment commands.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-proof-of-concept">The Proof of Concept</h2>

<p>This portfolio website serves as a proof of concept for a cost-free, automated content deployment workflow. By combining GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Prose.io, I’ve demonstrated that it’s possible to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Host a website for free.</li>
  <li>Automate the deployment process.</li>
  <li>Simplify content creation with a user-friendly interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach is ideal for developers, writers, and anyone looking to create a personal website or blog without incurring costs or dealing with complex infrastructure.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Building this portfolio website has been a rewarding experience, and it’s shown me the power of combining free, open-source tools to create a robust and efficient workflow. Whether you’re a developer looking to showcase your work or a writer wanting to share your thoughts, this proof of concept demonstrates that you don’t need a big budget to create a professional, hosted website.</p>
