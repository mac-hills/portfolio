# About me

I’m Wannes Machiels, a driven professional currently making a meaningful career transition into the IT sector. With a background in education as an administrative officer and secretary, I bring a unique blend of technical knowledge and strong soft skills to my new journey as a software developer.

I’m passionate about developing innovative software solutions that have a real, positive impact on people’s lives. This drive, combined with my natural curiosity and can-do attitude, forms the core of who I am as a professional. I’m always eager to learn and grow, seeking out challenges that help me refine my skills and contribute to projects that matter.

I believe that technology, when used effectively, has the power to transform communities and improve daily living. Whether it's building a seamless user experience or solving complex problems with code, my focus is on creating solutions that make a difference.

As I continue to expand my knowledge and experience in the tech world, I’m excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams to build products that make a meaningful impact.
