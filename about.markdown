## My Journey

I'm in the midst of an exciting career transformation from education administration to software development. This isn't just a career change—it's the alignment of my work with my deepest passions.

**Previous life:** Administrative officer and secretary in education  
**Current mission:** Creating software that solves real problems

## What Drives Me

> I believe technology should be both **beautiful** and **functional**.

My approach combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving:

- **Curiosity** – I'm always asking *"What if?"*
- **Impact** – I build solutions that make a difference
- **Growth** – Every challenge is an opportunity to learn
- **Collaboration** – The best ideas emerge when we work together

```javascript
while (alive) {
  learnNewSkills();
  buildAmazingThings();
  makeAnImpact();
}
```
